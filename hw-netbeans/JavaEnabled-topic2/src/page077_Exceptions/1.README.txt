Exceptions:
-----------
An exception is a runtime error condition. When the error occurs, an Exception
object is created and contains information about the error.
Many methods in the Java library can throw an exception.
When you call such a method, your method has to handle the exception.
Your method can handle the exception by 1) catching it, or 2) by throwing
the exception to the caller.

The methods you write can also throw exceptions.
You can create your own exception classes and throw those exceptions.
