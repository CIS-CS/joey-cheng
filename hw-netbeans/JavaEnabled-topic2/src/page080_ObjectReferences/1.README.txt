Object references
-----------------
An object-reference variable is a variable that contains a reference to an
object. The variable may refer to only one object at a time.
More than one object-reference variable may be pointing at a given object.
The following class illustrates this.

--------------------------------
TimeApp.java

    This class creates a Time2 object.  It creates two object-reference
    variables that each refer to the same Time2 object.
    It demonstrates that you can manipulate an object via any object-reference
    variable that refers to that object.
