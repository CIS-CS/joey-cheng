The term 'record' is not a Java term.  Java does not support records as such.  
In this context, record refers to a line in a text file, which may or may not
be in some sequence.
We can create a class to represent a file record.

VideoTape.java

    This class is an example of a 'composite data structure',
    or what other languages might call a 'record'.
    The VideoTape class is used to represent a video tape 'record' in a file.
    It is a class with some fields, and get/set methods to manipulate the fields.  
    That's it.  
    There is no main() method, thus, this class cannot be run as an application.
    The VideoTape class can be used by other classes.

VideoStore.java

    The class uses an array to store VideoTape objects.
    The program prompts the user for information about video tapes, and stores 
    the information in VideoTape objects.

*** Hierarchical composite data structure (HCDS) ***

    HCDS is one of the Mastery aspects for the Dossier.
    See --> Subject Guide > Assessment details > Mastery > High level
    The array of VideoTape objects in VideoStore is an example of a relatively 
    simple, hierarchical composite data structure.

Exercise 1:
    Improve the VideoStore application so that it can delete a VideoTape.
    (this has been done in VideoStore2 and VideoStore3. try to do this 
     exercise without looking at those classes)

       Add a delete option to the menu.
       The user will select the video number to be deleted.
    Two ways to do a delete: 
      1. shuffle the array to 'fill in' the empty element
         subsequent Add's would continue to be after the last element
      2. mark the deleted item as deleted, creating an available spot for the 
         next Add.
         subsequent Add's would look for a free element, or add at the end

Exercise 2:
    The doCommand() method in the VideoStore class is not very elegant.
    Imagine if there were 25 commands; the doCommand() method would become
    very long, and rather ugly.
    Think of a more elegant way to write this method using the switch statement.
    Note that a char can be treated as a positive integer.
    Add some additional commands that simply display the name of the command
    back to the user, eg, "You pressed the x command."

VideoStore2.java    

    This version does a Delete by shuffling the array.
    The List operation is relatively fast.

VideoStore3.java    

    This version does a Delete by setting the deleted item to null.      
    The Delete function creates a free space.
    The Add function now adds into the first free space.
    The List function has to check every element of the array.
