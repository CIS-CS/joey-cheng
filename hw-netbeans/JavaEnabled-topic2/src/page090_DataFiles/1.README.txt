Two kinds of data files are discussed: text files and random-access files.
    text files
        to access, use character streams
    RAF
        to access, use an RAF object

SimpleSeqFile.java

    This class writes to, and reads from, a sequential file.
    It prompts the user for their name, writes the name to the file, closes the 
    file. 
    It then opens the file, reads the file, displays the file contents to the
    screen.

    PrintWriter    --> FileWriter  --> file
    BufferedReader <-- FileReader  <-- file

    See also page096_ObjectSerialization (for I/O with objects instead of text)

    Note: create the Writer objects before creating the Reader objects.

SimpleSeqFileWebLog.java

    Very similar to SimpleSeqFile.java.  It does not prompt the user.
    It reads weblog.txt and adds an HTTP access code to each line of the file.
    The updated data is written to weblog2.txt
    This app was created to help out with exercise 4.59 in the Objects First
    book 3rd Ed.

weblog.txt

    The data file (text data) used by SimpleSeqFileWebLog.java
    This should go in the root folder of the Netbeans project.

VideoStore.java

    This is an enhanced version of the VideoStore class from page084_Records.
    At startup, the program reads VideoTape "records" from a text file and 
    stores them as VideoTape "objects" in an array.
    In addition to the add, list, quit commands, this version can delete
    VideoTape "objects" from the array. 
    The Save command writes the VideoTape objects from the array to a text file.

VideoTape.java

    Contains the details of a video tape object.
    This class is the same as the one in page084_Records, except that the
    constructor validates its arguments.

VideoTapeException.java

    The VideoTape constructor will throw a VideoTapeException if any of the
    arguments are invalid.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VideoStoreDatabase.java

    You can ignore this class.
    This is similar to the VideoStore class in page084_Records.  It has the add 
    and list commands, and reads the file on startup.  It does not do the
    Delete and Save commands.
