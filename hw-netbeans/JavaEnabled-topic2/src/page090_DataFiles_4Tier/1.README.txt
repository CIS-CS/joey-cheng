This set of classes illustrates a very simple, four-tier architecture for an
application.
    UI -- Object Model -- Persistence -- Datastore

UI = user interface.
The UI can be a GUI (graphical), or CLI (command line interface).

---------------------------
StudentLogger.java
    This class is is the user interface (CLI).

Student.java
    The object model. In this application there is only one class in the
    object model. There could be many.

Persister.java
    The persistence layer. This is the bridge between the world of objects in
    the object model, and the world of records in the datastore.

Datastore
    In this application, the datastore is a simple text file. In other
    applications the datastore could be an RAF (random access file) or an
    RDBMS (relational database management system). 
    RDBMS is not required for the course.
