These files are from the Sun Java Tutorial:
    Essential Java classes > Basic I/O

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CopyBytes.java   (byte streams)

    Uses byte streams to copy the data file, one byte at a time.
    Byte streams read and write bytes; low-level, physical I/O.
    Data is written to the beginning of the file; it is not appended to the
    end of the file.
    All other streams are built on byte streams.
    No real need to use byte streams.

    FileInputStream  <-- file
    FileOutputStream --> file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data.txt

    The data file for CopyBytes, CopyCharacters
    Put a copy of the file in the root folder your Netbeans project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CopyCharacters.java   (character streams)

    Uses character streams to copy the data file, one character at a time.
    Character streams use byte streams.
    Byte streams read/write bytes from the file, while character streams
    convert the bytes to characters.
    
    FileReader <-- FileInputStream  <-- file
    FileWriter --> FileOutputStream --> file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CopyLines.java    (line-oriented I/O; buffered I/O)

    Uses buffers to copy the data file, one line at a time.
    Disk reads occur when the buffer is empty.
    Disk writes occur when the buffer is full.
    More efficient because there are fewer trips to the disk.

    Buffered character streams:
        BufferedReader <-- FileReader <-- file
        BufferedWriter --> FileWriter --> file

    Buffered byte streams:
        BufferedInputStream  <-- InputStream  <-- file
        BufferedOutputStream <-- OutputStream <-- file

    This app uses BufferedReader, PrintWriter buffered-character-streams.
        BufferedReader <-- FileReader <-- file
        PrintWriter    --> FileWriter --> file

    Flush a stream: to force a write to the disk.

CopyFileGUI.java

    Makes copies of a OpenOffice ODT file.
    Reads a text file that contains student names.
    The student name is prepended to the front of each filename for each copy.

    Has a Swing user interface.
    Note that it uses the system LnF (look and feel), not the default Java LnF.
    Uses a BufferedReader to read the text file.
    Uses byte streams (FileInputStream, FileOutputStream) to dupe the file.

    Note also how the application shuts down. See the comment for the
    shutdownApplication() method.
