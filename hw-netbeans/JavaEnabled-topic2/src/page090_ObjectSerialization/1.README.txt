Object Serialization (not required for the course)
--------------------
You can read/write text to a sequential file.  You can also read/write whole 
objects to a sequential file.
When an object is written to a file, the object is 'serialized' (decomposed).  
When the same data is read back, the data is 'de-serialized' to recompose the 
object.

VideoTapeS.java
    This is the same as the VideoTape class in the "page090_DataFiles"
    package, except that it implements the Serializable interface.
    Objects that implement this interface can be serialized to a file.

VideoStoreS.java
    This class reads/writes VideoTapeS objects to/from a sequential file.
    An array is an object, so an entire array of objects can be written to the
    file.

    Text data: When we read/write text to the file, we use:

        write:  PrintWriter --> FileWriter --> file
        read:   file --> FileReader --> BufferedReader

    Object data: When we read/write whole objects to the file, we use:

        write:  ObjectOutputStream --> FileOutputStream --> file
        read:   file --> FileInputStream --> ObjectInputStream
