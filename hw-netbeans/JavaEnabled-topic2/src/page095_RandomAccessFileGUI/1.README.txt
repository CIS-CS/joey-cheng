Higher Level File Handling

RAF with GUI
------------
This version of the VideoStore application uses a GUI instead of a CLI (command 
line interface).

Note that it does not use the Persister class, so the I/O to the RAF is done in 
the VideoTapeFile object.

There is a bug in the application.  It lets you add a new video with the 
"On Loan" box selected.

--------------------------------------
VideoStoreRandomGUI.java

    This is similar to the original VideoStoreRandom class in that is reads and
    writes VideoTapeFile objects to an RAF, but this class has a Swing GUI.     
    The GUI includes navigation buttons, so you can "jump around" in the file.
    Because it is a RAF, you can move around the file in a way that you cannot 
    do with a sequential file.  For example, you can jump to the last record, 
    jump back to the first record, access the previous record, etc.

    Note however, that this application uses the VideoTapeFile class.  The
    VideoTapeFile class includes methods to read and write itself to the RAF.
    It works, but it is not an elegant design.  The I/O should be moved out to 
    a persister class.

    For detailed instructions on how to create the user interface see:
    moodle > CSHL > Resources > Swing and Netbeans > Create a simple GUI

    Note also how the application shuts down. See the comment for the
    shutdownApplication() method.

VideoTapeFile.java

    A VideoTape class that includes the read and write methods to the RAF.

VideoTape.java

    A simple video tape class, with no I/O methods.  This is what it should be
    and the I/O would be done by another class, such as a Persister class.

sec-students-v2.csv

    Data file for the exercise below.
    Default location for the file would be the root folder of the Netbeans project folder.

Exercises
1. Fix the 'On Loan' mentioned above.

2. Modify the application to use a persister class.
   You can use the VideoTape class instead of the VideoTapeFile class.
   Create a persister class, or modify the one from page095_RandomAccessFile

3. Project: create a new application: CIS Sec Student Info system. (820 students)
   raw data from Moongate provided as a CSV file.
   study the raw data and design a record layout.
   create an RAF with 1500 empty record 'slots'.
   write a utility to convert the CSV file to an RAF.
   store data in the RAF based on the student ID (offset = ID % 1000 * recSize)
   the system should have a GUI to display info for a student
   use navigation buttons for first, next, previous, last
   support 'search' by student ID (RAF seek)
