Trace Algorithms in Java

Page 103-105 in the book talks about how to trace an algorithm. The algorithm
and its description in the book are not very good.

The algorithm that they use deals with creating a full index to a data file.
The code is ugly.  Ignore it for now.

BookIndex.java
--------------


BadBookException.java
---------------------

    Simply extends Exception.java.  
    The constructor for the BookIndex class can throw this exception.


InsertBook.java
