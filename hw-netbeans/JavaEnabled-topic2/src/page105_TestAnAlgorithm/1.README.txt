Evaluate Algorithms in Java

This section talks about testing an algorithm to see if can handle various
data conditions.
1. Run the Shuffle application with various data sets to see if runs properly.
2. Edit the array to change the data set.
3. You will discover that there are problems with the algorithm.
   Your job is to isolate the problem without looking at Shuffle2.java

Shuffle.java
------------

    The class contains an array of Strings to represent names of people.
    Blank entries are indicated by "XXXX".
    The program attempts to shuffle the names to the left, and the 'XXXX'
    entries to the right.

    The algorithm has some problems. For example, it does not work for the
    test data provided on p.107 of the red book.
    See if you can fix the algorithm without looking at Shuffle2.java

Shuffle2.java
-------------

    This class fixes problems in Shuffle.java

Exercise
--------
In an attempt to automate the testing of this algorithm, place the test data
into a file. Each set of test data should be a separate record in the file.
Read each file record, create the names[] array, do the shuffle, and display
the shuffled result. Display the un-shuffled data followed by the shuffled data.
Compose the test data file with as many scenarios as you can think of.
