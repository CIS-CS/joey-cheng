Example of String Manipulation

This example "tokenizes" a string using string manipulation.
A token is a component of a larger string; a token is a group of characters
seperated by a delimiter.

Tokenizer.java
--------------
    This class uses the StringBuffer class and String manipulation to implement 
    a tokenizer program.
    Not sure how useful this is since it is OK for you to use the StringTokenizer 
    class from the library. (see FileTokenizer below)

Tokenizer2.java
---------------
    This version prompts the user for a string, and then displays the tokens of
    the string.

FileTokenizer.java
------------------
    This application writes a record to a sequential file. The words are the
    tokens, the spaces are the delimiters.
    It then reads the record from the file, uses the StringTokenizer class to
    extract the tokens from the record, and displays the tokens.

    Note that you can also use the split method in the String class to
    parse fields from a record.
