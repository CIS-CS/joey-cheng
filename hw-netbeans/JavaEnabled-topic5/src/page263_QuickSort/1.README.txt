QuickSort.java
--------------

Implements the quick sort algorithm.
See topic 5.2 on moodle for more information.
Efficiency is O(nlogn), on average.
Worst case space complexity = n.
The algorithm is recursive. Sorts the left side, then the right side, recursively.

Exercise:
1. Run the algorithm with different data.
   Vary the range of the data set.
   Data from a smaller set will have more duplicates than data from a larger
   set. Does data with more duplicates sort faster?
   Run it with sorted data and worst case data.

2. Run the application with different data set size.
   Do you see any patterns?
