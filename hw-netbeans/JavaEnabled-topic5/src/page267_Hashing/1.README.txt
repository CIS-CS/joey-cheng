Hashing involves:
    hash key -> hash function -> hash value -> index to hash table
    A hash key (eg, a student ID + name) is passed to a hash function.
    The hash function hashes (grinds up) the key to produce a hash value.
    The hash value is used as in index into a hash table.
    Information associated with the key is stored in the hash table.

    int hashValue = hashFunction(String hashKey);
    hashTable[hashValue][o] = the key
    hashTable[hashValue][1] = the data associated with the key

HashTable.java
    Has the skeleton of a hash table in an array (static hash table).
    Needs to be fleshed out.

JRRHasherApp.java
    This class inserts words from JRR Tolkien's Telerin language into a
    hash table. The hash table could be used as a lookup table by
    a Telerin spell checker to quickly find valid Telerin words.
    This version does not check for collisions.

    If you want to display source code in an HTML page, it is nice to be
    able to maintain the formatting of the source.
    Use the <pre> and </pre> tags to retain the source formattting.
    Create an empty HTML file:
        R-click the project, New, HTML file
    In the <body>, add the <pre> and </pre> tags.
    Paste the source code between the <pre> tags.
    View the HTML file in a browser.
