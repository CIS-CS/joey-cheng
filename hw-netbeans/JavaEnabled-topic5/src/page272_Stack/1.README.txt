Static Stack
A stack can be implemented using an Array or a List.
The classes in this package use an array to implement a stack.
Arrays cannot change size at runtime, so we say the stack is static (in size).
Lists can change size at runtime, so we say the link-based stack is dynamic.

StackApp.java
    Used to test the Stack class.
    Creates a Stack object and calls push(), pop(), and then displays the stack.

Stack.java
    Implements a stack in an array, thus, it is a static stack, ie, the
    stack size cannot grow beyond the size of the array.
    The stack pointer (SP) points to the top element in the stack.
    If the stack is empty, SP equals -1.

RPNCalculatorApp.java

    Not implemented.
    Should be able to evaluate an RPN expression.
    A stack works well for evaluating an expression that is expressed in RPN.
    For example, the expression ab+ (where a and b are numbers) could be
    pushed onto the stack, and then evaluated by pushing and popping as 
    necessary.

RPNCalculatorStack.java

    Not implemented.
    should implement a stack, to be used by RPNCalculatorApp.
