SingleListApp.java
    A console application that uses SingleList to hold a list of int's.

SingleList.java
    From p.288 in the red book.
    Implements the add() method on a singly-linked list.
    (The Class in the book is named Llist)

Exercise:
implement the remove() method in SingleList.java

-------------------

FileListApplet.java
    An applet that uses a singly-linked list to hold FileNode objects.
    Each node holds a key and an offset into a file.
    The nodes are in sequence, by key.
    The application is not well designed in that the list operations are woven
    into the application. The list stuff should be in a separate class.

FileNode.java
    Used by FileListApplet
    Each node holds a key and an offset into a file.

-------------------

DoubleListAppGUI.java
    User enters names; names are stored in a doubly-linked list.
    The list is displayed as user adds/removes names.
    A Swing application that uses the DoubleList class to hold the names
    that the user enters.

DoubleList.java
    Implements a doubly-linked list.
    Head points to first node, tail points to last node, current points to
    most recently inserted (MRI) node.

DoubleNode.java
    Used by DoubleList.java
    Contains the data, plus previous and next 'pointers'.

-------------------

DoubleListApplet.java
    An applet;  prompts user to insert items into the list.
    Uses the DoubleList class.
    Supports insertion at the head and tail only.
    It is included here just for kicks.
    You do not need to know how to write applets.
