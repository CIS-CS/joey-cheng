Queues operate on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
This dynamic queue is implemented using a singly-linked list.
Nodes are added at the tail (enqueued) and removed from the head (dequeued), 
just like in a supermarket queue.
Each node holds information about a customer.

CustomerQueueAppGUI.java

    A Swing application that uses a CustomerQueue to manage customers at a
    service counter.
    Note that the application will close when the user clicks on File > Exit,
    and also when the user clicks on the X button in the upper right of the
    application window. 
    Your application should respond to both so that it always shuts down
    gracefully.
    Note, the ActionListeners are not implemented, ie, button clicks do not
    do anything.

SingtelQueueApplet.java

    This class was replaced by CustomerQueueApp.java
    This is an (ugly) applet that manages a queue of customers.
    This is an applet where the Swing interface is writing by hand, rather
    than with the form editor in Netbeans.
